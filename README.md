# Car-Company-Coursework
Coursework requirement was to create a GUI based program to manage the renting and buying of cars from a fictional car company.

Allows users to add cars that are to be rented or bought. Allows for the user to mark a car as bought or rented, also allows 
for the user to lookup the ID of any car and display information relating to it.

Current functionality does not save the cars that have been created (After the program is closed) as that was not required by the coursework, however it could 
easily be implemented through the use of a MySQL database to store the data.
